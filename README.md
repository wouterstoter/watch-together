# Watch Together
A tool that allows you to watch videos together with people.
You can use videofiles from the web, or upload your own.
Because the video isn't shared via screen-sharing, but instead uploaded to the web, the video-quality is much better for all participants, because the browser can use buffering.

# External tools
This program uses [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) for the videocalling, and [GoFile.io](https://gofile.io/) for uploading and streaming videofiles.
